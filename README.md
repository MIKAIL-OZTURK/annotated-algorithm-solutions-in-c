# 🧠 Annotated Algorithm Practice in C

Welcome to my personal algorithm practice repository, where I solve a wide range of algorithmic problems using the **C programming language**, enhanced with **detailed annotations** and **step-by-step explanations**.

This repository is based on the PDF titled **"Açıklamalı Algoritma Örnek Soruları ve Çözümleri"**, and it's part of my daily routine to sharpen my problem-solving and low-level programming skills.
